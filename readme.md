Welcome to my GitHub. If you're here, you're either lost, curious, or desperately trying to figure out why your forked copy of my project is on fire. Whatever the case: welcome.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Philosophy

I believe in doing things **the hard way** ‚Äî not because it‚Äôs trendy, but because **the hard way is the only way you really learn anything**. I live and breathe the [suckless](https://suckless.org) philosophy: do less, but do it well. If I can‚Äôt write it, read it, or rip it apart in a terminal, I don‚Äôt want it.

I use Arch Linux. Not because I want to brag, but because Stockholm Syndrome is real.

Most of my code is written in **C** (because who needs safety?) or **Python** (for when I want my code to at least pretend to like me). I build my systems from scratch, down to the dotfiles, because every dependency is a potential betrayal.

## üß† Why I Program

Because building things from nothing is the closest you get to sorcery in the modern world ‚Äî and also because emotionally bonding with a kernel panic at 2am is cheaper than therapy.

Programming is how I make sense of the chaos. Sometimes I automate things. Sometimes I break them just to see how deep the rabbit hole goes. Occasionally, I fix them. All the time, I learn.

## üé¨ Favorite Movie

*The Princess Bride* ‚Äî because no matter how many systems crash or segfault, **true love (and `fork()`) will always find a way.**
