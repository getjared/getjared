Welcome to my GitHub. If you're here, you're either lost, curious, or desperately trying to figure out why your forked copy of my project is on fire. Whatever the case: welcome.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Philosophy

I believe in doing things **the hard way** ‚Äî not because it‚Äôs trendy, but because **the hard way is the only way you really learn anything**. I live and breathe the [suckless](https://suckless.org) philosophy: do less, but do it well. If I can‚Äôt write it, read it, or rip it apart in a terminal, I don‚Äôt want it.

I use Arch Linux. Not because I want to brag, but because Stockholm Syndrome is real.

Most of my code is written in **C** (because who needs safety?) or **Python** (for when I want my code to at least pretend to like me). I build my systems from scratch, down to the dotfiles, because every dependency is a potential betrayal.
