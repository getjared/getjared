Verily, in these modern times, there exists a peculiar contradiction in the realm of display servers. They speak of Wayland as if it were a newborn child, fresh to our world, yet I say unto thee: this "modern" creation first drew breath in the year of our Lord 2008. Let us contemplate this paradox, for time itself doth not make a thing modern, nor doth age make it wise.

In the sacred texts of Linux, handed down through generations, there exists one commandment most holy: "Thou shalt not break user space." Simple in its utterance, yet profound in its wisdom. Alas, here lies the first transgression of Wayland against the natural order.

## 𝔒𝔫 𝔱𝔥𝔢 𝔑𝔞𝔱𝔲𝔯𝔢 𝔬𝔣 𝔖𝔦𝔪𝔭𝔩𝔦𝔠𝔦𝔱𝔶 𝔞𝔫𝔡 ℭ𝔬𝔪𝔭𝔩𝔢𝔵𝔦𝔱𝔶

Consider, if thou will, the marriage of display server and compositor in Wayland's realm. While this union may appear virtuous in its simplicity, it doth strip away the rich tapestry of features that X-Windowing, in its wisdom, has preserved. Like a painter restricted to but one brush, the artist's expression becomes limited, though the canvas be fresh.

## 𝔒𝔫 𝔱𝔥𝔢 ℑ𝔩𝔩𝔲𝔰𝔦𝔬𝔫 𝔬𝔣 𝔖𝔭𝔢𝔢𝔡

They speak of latency as if it were a great burden, yet I ask thee: can mortal eyes perceive the difference of milliseconds? 'Tis like counting grains of sand in an hourglass - the difference exists only in numbers, not in experience.

## 𝔒𝔫 𝔱𝔥𝔢 𝔉𝔞𝔩𝔩𝔞𝔠𝔶 𝔬𝔣 𝔖𝔢𝔠𝔲𝔯𝔦𝔱𝔶

Let us speak of security, for here lies another tale of misconception. They claim Wayland's isolation brings forth greater protection, yet X-Windowing has long since fortified its walls. 'Tis like claiming a new lock is better, while ignorant that the old lock was replaced with one equally strong many moons ago.

Consider the user, dear reader, for without them, our creations are as hollow as an empty vessel. When Wayland breaks the tools of old - the screenshots, the sharing of screens, the management of windows - they speak not of their own failings, but point fingers at others, like a poor craftsman blaming his tools.

## ℭ𝔬𝔫𝔠𝔩𝔲𝔰𝔦𝔬𝔫

The trouble with Wayland, I submit to thee, lies not in its ambitions but in its disregard for the sacred covenant between creator and user. It breaks not just tools, but trust; not just protocols, but promises.

Linux was chosen by the people for its respect of their freedom and needs. Yet Wayland walks a path more akin to those from whom we sought refuge - the Microsoft and Google of our realm. It represents not progress, but regression from our cherished principles.
